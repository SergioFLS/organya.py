# organya.py
Hand-port of [organya.js](https://github.com/alula/organya-js) to the Python programming language.

## Current status
Port is complete and playback sounds fine (to me, anyway). One huge problem with it though, is the abysmal performance (For real-time playback, I have to lower the sample rate to 11025Hz, and even then it still gets choppy for a few moments).

## Thanks
* [@alula](https://github.com/alula) for organya-js
* Rxo Inverse and Studio Pixel for releasing OrgMaker's source code
